**Learn by building. Grow by reviewing. Teach by creating.**

p2pHub is a next-generation education platform built on peer-to-peer collaboration.  
No instructors. No rigid courses. Just real projects, XP, reviews, and growth.

---

## MVP Vision

We believe that:
- Education should be interactive, project-based, and social.
- Peer reviews can be a powerful learning tool.
- Anyone can become a mentor, reviewer, or creator — through experience.

---

## Core Mechanics

- **3 peer reviews per project**  
- **XP from 0 to 100** based on reviews + auto-tests  
- **P2P Points economy** (earned by reviewing others, spent on submissions)  
- **Appeals system** (1 per project, reviewed by curators/admins)  
- **Calendaring for reviews** (with time-based P2P point logic)  
- **Review flags:** `cheating`, `good code`, `bear service`, etc.  
- **Skill radar + progress charts**  
- **Multilingual support + integrated translation for review**  
- **Embedded terminal + time tracker**  
- **Real-time chat + AI assistants (non-intrusive)**
